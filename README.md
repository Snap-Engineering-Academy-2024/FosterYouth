# Give Fund Prototype

Give Fund is a proposed Snapchat feature aimed at helping foster youth nonprofits raise funds for their impactful programs. 
Give Fund would let users donate in two ways: their own funds or Snap Give Coins. Users would earn 1 Give Coin for every sponsored video from nonprofits. Users can keep track of their Give Coins in their user profile or under a nonprofit's campaign progress bar. When a user donates to a nonprofit, their bitmoji gets added to the Bitmoji community to show their support.

## Process
This prototype was built by our cross-functional team of designers, storytellers and engineers. Over the course of 2 weeks, we brought Give Fund to life from ideation to functional prototype. We initially met with Kids in the Spotlight, and based on our discussions, we designed Give Fund. The designers created mockups and wireframes on Figma, which we would then use to code our prototype. Throughout the process, we were given feedback which we considered when updating our prototype.
